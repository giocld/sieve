SIEVE ANALYTICS: STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY

This document explains the mathematical formulas and logic used to calculate the key metrics in the Sieve dashboard.

================================================================================
1. PLAYER METRIC: VALUE GAP
================================================================================
The "Value Gap" quantifies how much a player outperforms (or underperforms) their contract. It answers the question: "Is this player producing more on the court than they are being paid for?"

FORMULA:
Value Gap = Normalized Impact - Normalized Salary

STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION:

A. Normalize Salary (0-100 Scale)
   We convert a player's raw salary into a percentile-like score relative to the rest of the league.
   
   Salary_Norm = 100 * (Player_Salary - Min_Salary) / (Max_Salary - Min_Salary)

   - If a player makes the league minimum, their score is 0.
   - If a player makes the league maximum, their score is 100.

B. Normalize Impact (0-100 Scale)
   We do the same for the player's LEBRON Impact score.
   
   Impact_Norm = 100 * (Player_LEBRON - Min_LEBRON) / (Max_LEBRON - Min_LEBRON)

   - The worst player in the dataset gets a 0.
   - The best player (MVP level) gets a 100.

C. Calculate the Gap
   Value Gap = Impact_Norm - Salary_Norm

INTERPRETATION:
   - Positive Gap (+): UNDERPAID. The player's production score is higher than their pay score.
     Example: Impact Score 80 (Star) - Salary Score 20 (Rookie Scale) = +60 Gap.
   
   - Negative Gap (-): OVERPAID. The player's pay score is higher than their production score.
     Example: Impact Score 30 (Role Player) - Salary Score 90 (Max Contract) = -60 Gap.

   - Zero Gap (0): FAIR VALUE. The player is paid exactly commensurate with their production.

================================================================================
2. TEAM METRIC: EFFICIENCY INDEX
================================================================================
The "Efficiency Index" measures how well a Front Office converts money into wins. It rewards teams that win a lot while spending little, and penalizes teams that spend a lot but lose.

FORMULA:
Efficiency Index = Z-Score(Wins) - Z-Score(Payroll)

STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION:

A. Z-Score of Wins
   Measures how many standard deviations a team's win total is from the league average.
   
   Z_Wins = (Team_Wins - League_Avg_Wins) / Standard_Deviation_Wins

   - Positive Z: Team wins more than average.
   - Negative Z: Team wins less than average.

B. Z-Score of Payroll
   Measures how many standard deviations a team's payroll is from the league average.
   
   Z_Payroll = (Team_Payroll - League_Avg_Payroll) / Standard_Deviation_Payroll

   - Positive Z: Team spends more than average.
   - Negative Z: Team spends less than average.

C. Calculate the Index
   We prioritize winning over cost-savings by weighting Wins by a factor of 2.0.
   
   Index = (2.0 * Z_Wins) - Z_Payroll

INTERPRETATION:
   - High Positive Score: ELITE EFFICIENCY.
     The team is winning significantly more than average. Because Wins are weighted double, a high win total is the surest way to a high score.
     
   - High Negative Score: INEFFICIENT.
     The team is losing more than average or spending an exorbitant amount for mediocre results.

================================================================================
3. SOURCE DATA: LEBRON METRIC
================================================================================
The primary input for "Impact" is the LEBRON metric (Luck-adjusted player Estimate using a Box prior Regularized ON-off).

- What it measures: Impact per 100 possessions.
- Scale: 
  - +0.00 is League Average.
  - +3.00 is All-Star level.
  - +5.00 is MVP level.
  - -2.00 is Replacement level.

Sieve uses this metric because it accounts for role, efficiency, and team context better than raw box score stats like Points Per Game.
